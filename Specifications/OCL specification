3. "Every deployed sensor must be associated with a location that exists in the correspond- ing location registry"

4. "Every location maintained by the system is associated with a unique sensor"

context Location
  inv: self.allInstances() → forAll(L1, L2 | L1 <> L2 implies L1.sensor <> L2.sensor)
